Principles, Patterns and Rules represent different levels of guidance detail. 


Design **Patterns** provides low-level solutions related to implementation, of commonly occurring object-oriented problems. In other words, design pattern suggests a specific implementation for the specific object-oriented programming problem. 


For example, if you want to create a class that can only have one object at a time, then you can use the Singleton design pattern which suggests the best way to create a class that can only have one object. Design patterns are tested by others and are safe to follow, e.g. Gang of Four patterns: Abstract Factory, Factory, Singleton, Command, etc.

# Principles


## Saltzer Secure Software Design Principles
Some of the earliest secure software design principles were proposed by Saltzer in the 1970's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltzer_and_Schroeder%27s_design_principles

1 Economy of mechanism: Keep the design as simple and small as possible.

2 Fail-safe defaults: Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion.

3 Complete mediation: Every access to every object must be checked for authority.

4 Open design: The design should not be secret.

5 Separation of privilege: Where feasible, a protection mechanism that requires two keys to unlock it is more robust and flexible than one that allows access to the presenter of only a single key.

6 Least privilege: Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job.

7 Least common mechanism: Minimize the amount of mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users.

8 Psychological acceptability: It is essential that the human interface be designed for ease of use, so that users routinely and automatically apply the protection mechanisms correctly.

9 Work factor: Compare the cost of circumventing the mechanism with the resources of a potential attacker.

10 Compromise recording: It is sometimes suggested that mechanisms that reliably record that a compromise of information has occurred can be used in place of more elaborate mechanisms that completely prevent loss.

### Other Useful Secure Software Development Principles
1. Minimize the footprint of sensitive data - in time and space
   
   1.1 How long or how often the Sensitive data exists

   1.2 Where the sensitive data exists or flows -  the code or interfaces that touch the sensitive data.

## SOLID
SOLID is an acronym for the first 5 principles of object-oriented design:

1. SRP The Single Responsibility Principle: -- a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2. OCP The Open Closed Principle: -- you should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.
3. LSP The Liskov Substitution Principle: -- derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4. ISP The Interface Segregation Principle: -- make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
5. DIP The Dependency Inversion Principle -- depend on abstractions not on concrete implementations.





# Patterns

The term "design pattern" is often used to refer to any pattern which addresses issues of software architecture, design, or programming implementation. 

> "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our
environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.‚Äù Christopher Alexander



## Architecture Patterns


An Architecture Pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization or schema for software systems. It provides a set of predefined subsystems, specifies their responsibilities, and includes rules and guidelines for organizing the relationships between them.

Architectural-level patterns focus on the high-level allocation of responsibilities between different components of the system and define the interaction between
those high-level components.


### SEI Secure Architecture Patterns 
1. Distrustful Decomposition 6
2. PrivSep (Privilege Separation) 9
3. Defer to Kernel 


## Design Patterns
A Design Pattern provides a scheme for refining the subsystems or components of a 
software system, or the relationships between them. It describes a commonly recurring structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within a particular context.

The term "design pattern" is often used to refer to any pattern which addresses issues of software architecture, design, or programming implementation. In Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns, the authors define these three types of patterns as follows:


Design-level patterns describe how to design and implement pieces
of a high-level system component, that is, they address problems in the internal design of a single high-level component, not the definition and interaction of high-level components
themselves. The design-level patterns defined in this document are

### SEI Secure Design Patterns
[SEI Secure Design Patterns](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9115) defines the following Secure Design Patterns:
1. Secure Factory
2. Secure Strategy Factory
3. Secure Builder Factory
4. Secure Chain of Responsibility
5. Secure State Machine
6. Secure Visitor 


[SEI Secure Design Patterns](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9115) describes a set of general solutions to software security problems that can be applied in many different situations.
