Trello has many uses - including as a virtual bookshelf organised by the value it delivers to you.

Organize books by value to you
1. the area you want to learn about 
2. the value of each book in that area
3. Complement the book with an independent presentation of the material e.g. a powerpoint, a youtube video
   1. Multiple independent forms of learning enrich the learning e.g. read a book then watch the youtube videos by the author

1. "Investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. It will not only improve your life, it will improve the lives of all those around you"
2. "Everything in your life can be taken away from you except for your knowlege, network, ability. Gaining ownership over these three things will accelerate your progress on the path to Intelligent Achieivement"
3. "Successful people are normal people who have learned how to scale themselves really well"
